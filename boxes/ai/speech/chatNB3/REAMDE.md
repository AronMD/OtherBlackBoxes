# ChatNB3

Let's have a conversation with our NB3 (powered by Whisper, GPT and TTS)

## Microophones (NB3 Ears)?
Are you microphones working? If so, then you should be ready to go!

## Adding a speaker
You can connect any speaker with a standard 3.5 mm plug (the headphone plug) into the jack on your raspberry pi, directly next to where the camera connects,

## Install required Python packages
pip3 install openai
pip3 install pyttsx3

## Install text-to-speech library
sudo apt install espeak

### OpenAI API Key
This is a special code that you can get from OpenAI that allows you to send requests to their computers running very large neural networks. Each time you make a request, they charge a very tiny amount of money. This is their business model. I will provide you with an OpenAI key to use during the course...but please don't share it with the internet. (It has a spending cap, but it will be quickly used up if the "world" gets access.)
