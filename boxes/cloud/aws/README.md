# Cloud : AWS

Using the cloud for compute and storage (Amazon Web Services)

## Setting up an EC2 instance for GPU compute

- Request a vCPU limit increase (seems to take awhile). Requires 8 vCPUs for a p3.2x

- Select an arch distribution for your region (eu-west-2 is London)
  - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Linux_AMIs_for_Amazon_Web_Services
  - There are optimized builds for EC2

- Wait for limit increase
