# Flight

Can we make an NB3 fly?

## Design
- Quadcopter (4-rotor) design
- NB3 Body (weight: 127.7 grams) with aluminium(?) extension frame
- LiPo Battery (4S - 4 cells - 14.8 Volts) - 2200 mAh - XT60 plug - (230 g)
- ESC (x4): KV = RPM per Volt (Low KV needs more voltage for same speed, but has higher torque, i.e. can use larger propellers)
  - 30 A?
- Motor: 22 (stator) 05 (magnet height)? - KV: 220-2800?
- Accelerometer/Gyro/GPS(?)
- Propeller: 5"

Motor 2205 - 2300 KV: Voltage - 4S -
