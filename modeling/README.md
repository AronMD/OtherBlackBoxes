# Modeling

Creating realistic 3D models for use in computer graphics and games is a fundamental skill, albeit one with a steep learning curve. This box will guide you through the creation of digital models using the open-source software tool [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

## Your first scene

When you open Blender, you will see a cube, a camera, and a light. Zoom-in on the cube, select it, and press tab to Enter Edit mode.

### Edges, Faces, Vertices
- Move some of the vertices around.
