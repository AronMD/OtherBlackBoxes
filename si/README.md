# SI Units

Where do they come from? How are they defined?

## 
the 7 base units and their corrosponding constants:

second - time - hyperfine transmission frequency of caesium
metre - distance - speed of light
kilogram - mass - Planck's constant
ampere - current - elementary charge (charge of an electron)
kelvin - tempertaure - Boltzman constant
mole - an avocadro's number of something - Avogadro's number
candela - intensity of light - luminous efficacy

history:
orginated as a result that the centimetre - second - gram system, a system which seeked to define all untis using only those three base units, had two sets of units for the two constiuent part of the electromagnetic field. These differed by the speed of light, then following maxwell's paper which ultimtely unified the fields did this relation become explained with the proposed electromagnetic wave - aka light - which travels with constant speed, c = 1/sqrt(mu_0 epsilon_r).

there has been a push in the scientific community to define these units not using artefacts - which can naturally change with time and introduce irremovable uncertaintities when replicating - and instead towards idealised and abstract definitons, which do not suffer from such limitations.


TO Do for demonstration:

- calc c
- calc e
- calc boltzman??
